# Variable Autoencoder on Celebrity Faces dataset

This script demonstrates the process of building and training a VAE using Keras to generate new faces. The script used the CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) for training the VAE model. Model is trained using the Pytorch framework.

The model is trained using 10 epochs. The scripts with all executed outputs can be seen from my [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/junkal/generating-new-faces-with-variational-autoencoders?scriptVersionId=76840382).

Sample output of faces generated from the trained autoencoder:
